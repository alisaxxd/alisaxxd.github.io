     <img src="adamsfamily.jpg"alt="adamsfamily"> 
     <p1>I choose to do my project base on the Netflix show called Wednesday. The website will be have five pages including the home page and the main characters; Wednesday, Enid, Tyler, and Xavier. I choose
        this topic because I haven't enjoyed a show this much in a while and it's different from what I usually do. I ususlly do cutesy and bright concepts so i'm excited to be jumping out fo my comfort zone with this project.</p1>

    <p>Growing up in the early to late 20's I had a lot of memeories that stuck with me to this day. Growing up, I really loved playing videos as well as disney channel and Nickelodeon. I would always watch theses shows before catching the bus in the morning or stay up waiting for a new episode. During this time, I was also obessed with anything mario and playing the Wii. It brings back memories when I would have sleepovers with my cousins and our favortie thing was staying up all night playing the wii.</p>
