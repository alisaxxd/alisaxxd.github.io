    <h1>Inspiring sites</h1>
    <p>Here are some websites I finds pretty</p>
    <img src="inspo1.png"alt="inspo1">
    <a href="https://compost.recyc-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/">inspo1</a>
    <p>I am really drawn to the color palette and the way they display their data.</p>

    <a href="https://www.poura-drinkkultur.de/">inspo2</a>
    <p>I am really drawn to the front page and they way they make the bottle interactive throughout their website.</p>

    <p>The use of space and 3D art is really well done here. The color palette is super pretty and eye catching.</p>
    <h2>Project one journal entry</h2>
     <img src="adamsfamily.jpg"alt="adamsfamily"> 
     <p1>I choose to do my project base on the Netflix show called Wednesday. The website will be have five pages including the home page and the main characters; Wednesday, Enid, Tyler, and Xavier. I choose
        this topic because I haven't enjoyed a show this much in a while and it's different from what I usually do. I ususlly do cutesy and bright concepts so i'm excited to be jumping out fo my comfort zone with this project.</p1>

    <p>Growing up in the early to late 20's I had a lot of memeories that stuck with me to this day. Growing up, I really loved playing videos as well as disney channel and Nickelodeon. I would always watch theses shows before catching the bus in the morning or stay up waiting for a new episode. During this time, I was also obessed with anything mario and playing the Wii. It brings back memories when I would have sleepovers with my cousins and our favortie thing was staying up all night playing the wii.</p>
    <h2>Two sites I would revamp</h2>
    <a href="https://www.mybrotherscrawfish.net/">inspo2</a>
    <p>When I go onto this website, the first that comes to my mind is where is the Navigation bar. I think I would first start off with a Navigation bar to help organize the website. I also like the use of picture in this website, but I think it could be done in a more animated 
        illustrated way. I was thinking some kind of pop animation with the pictures and some fun illustated animation to bring some life into the website. I also think this website would be fun to use a scroll down hompage showing the menu. </p>
    <a href="https://justtea.us/">inspo2</a>
    <p>I wouldn't say this website is horrible or done super poorly, but I do think it can be organized in a better way. For example, as I scroll down each section would pop up. I would also change the type into something that has more character since the logo uses a lot of curves. I would also add the address to the end of the homepage along with a map of their location.</p>
