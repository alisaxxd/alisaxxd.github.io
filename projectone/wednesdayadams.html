            <h2>INTJ</h2>
            <p>Wednesday is intelligent and tends to question the world around her. Typically, she prefers to make her own decisions about what makes logical sense rather than following traditions for the sake of it. When communicating, Wednesday is direct and prefers to get straight to the point.
            </p>
